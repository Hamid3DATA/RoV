# RoV

### This is a RoV project i did at my school.

### [!NOTE]
All the .sh scripts you will find under the [files](https://github.com/Hamid3DATA/RoV/tree/main/files) folder were made by me. While the python codes were found on the internet(not by me)

The [Rroject RoV.docx](https://github.com/Hamid3DATA/RoV/blob/main/Prosjekt%20RoV.docx) file showcases how i did everything (in Norwegian :/). In there you can also find all the links to codes and instructions i found online.
<br />

Maybe someday i will translate it into English
