# RoV

### This is a RoV project i did at my school.

### [!NOTE]
All the .sh scripts you will find under [files](https://github.com/Hamid3DATA/RoV/tree/main/files) folder were made by me. While the python codes were found on the internet(not by me)

The "Rroject RoV.docx" file showcases how i did everything (in Norwegian :/). It also showcases where exactly i found some of the python codes and instructions.
Maybe someday i will translate it into English
